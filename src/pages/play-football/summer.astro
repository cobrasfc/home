			Our Summer Football competition is a fun, fast-paced way to stay connected, stay fit, and keep enjoying

		</p>
		<p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-sm text-slate-700">
			Whether you’re returning with your regular team, playing socially with friends, or trying football for the
			first time, summer football offers a relaxed and welcoming environment with a strong community focus.

				<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">What Is Summer Football?</h2>
				<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">Summer football at Metford Cobras is played as:</p>
				<ul class="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700">
					<li>Six-a-side</li>
					<li>On a smaller-sized field</li>
					<li>With games running at half the length of a normal match</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					The shorter format makes games quicker, more social, and easier to fit around summer schedules—while still
					delivering plenty of action and touches on the ball.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Who Can Play?</h2>
				<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">Our summer competition is open to:</p>
				<ul class="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700">
					<li>Junior players</li>
					<li>Senior players</li>
					<li>Adult mixed teams</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					The mixed competition is a popular option for adults looking for a social, inclusive way to play, with an
					emphasis on enjoyment and participation rather than results.
