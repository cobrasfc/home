		<p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-sm text-slate-700">
			At Metford Cobras, junior football is about more than just learning how to kick a ball. It’s about building
			confidence, friendships, and a lifelong love of the game in a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-sm text-slate-700">
			We proudly support three levels of junior football, with programs designed to suit different ages, abilities,
			and stages of development.
		</p>

				<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Entry Level Football (Ages 5–7)</h2>
				<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">This is where the football journey begins.</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					Our entry level program is focused on fun, movement, and basic skills, with an emphasis on enjoyment and
					participation rather than results.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					Sessions are designed to be relaxed and encouraging, helping kids feel comfortable on the field—especially
					those trying football for the first time.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					To help families get started, all new players in the entry level competition receive free socks and shin pads.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					This program is open to boys and girls, and no prior football experience is required.

				<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Youth Football (Ages 12–18)</h2>
				<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
					Youth football provides a pathway for older players to continue developing their skills in a more
					competitive and structured setting, while still maintaining the strong community values of the club.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">At this level, players are supported to:</p>
				<ul class="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700">
					<li>Improve technical and tactical understanding</li>
					<li>Build resilience and leadership</li>
					<li>Enjoy football in a positive team environment</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
					We cater for a range of abilities and remain committed to being welcoming and inclusive, whether a player is
					highly experienced or new to organised football.
