			Senior football at Metford Cobras is about staying active, enjoying the game, and being part of a connected
			football community—no matter your age, background, or experience.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-sm text-slate-700">
			We offer social, low-grade senior football that is welcoming, inclusive, and designed for players who want to
			enjoy the game without the pressure of high-level competition.

			<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">Football for the Whole Family</h2>
			<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">
				One of the things that makes Metford Cobras special is the strong connection between our junior and senior
				teams.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
				Many players in our senior and over-35s teams are parents of children playing in our junior program. Playing
				at the same club creates a shared experience and a great way for families to connect through football—on and
				off the field.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">To support this:</p>
			<ul class="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700">
				<li>We offer family discounts where possible</li>
				<li>We try to accommodate game-day schedules to make it easier for parents and children to play at the same club</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
				Whether it’s cheering each other on, training at the same grounds, or sharing post-game moments, football
				becomes something the whole family can be part of.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="mt-4 card">
			<h2 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-900">A Welcoming, Social Club</h2>
			<p class="mt-2 text-sm text-slate-700">Across all senior teams, Metford Cobras is committed to:</p>
			<ul class="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700">
				<li>A welcoming, inclusive environment</li>
				<li>Social teams that prioritise enjoyment and community</li>
				<li>Supporting players balancing football with work, family, and life</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mt-4 text-sm text-slate-700">
				If you’re looking to get back into football, try the game for the first time, or join a club where families
				and community come first, there’s a place for you at Metford Cobras.
